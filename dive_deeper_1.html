    <h1>Dive Deeper 1</h1>
<P>Historic City Park Golf Course in the Baton Rouge Garden District has been under threat from a cabal of city leaders for over two decades.  This never ending threat has reached its pivotal moment NOW in JANUARY AND FEBRUARY 2026. We need you to educate yourself and become a concerned citizen to help save this Historic Landmark.  We need you to dig deep into the roots of this ongoing problem and demand that City Park Golf Course retain its current footprint, scale, and scope. Tell your city leaders, tell the newspaper, tell the television broadcasters, tell BRAF, tell your neighbors we do not want to re-imagine City Park if that entails destroying the existing golf course, reducing its historic nine-hole format, shrinking the size of the fairways and/or destroying or minimizing a cultural icon of Baton Rouge that has severed as a recreational resource for the entire Parish and State since its creation in 1929 during the Great Depression.  Progress does not mean bulldozers and construction to replace City Park Golf Course's historical fairways and greens with new buildings, parking lots, arboretums and boat houses.  City Park Golf Course was designed to play golf and provide a green environment with an active lifestyle.

<P>Your Civic Leaders at BREC are already underway to avoid public comment and hide their plans in restricted "stakeholder" meetings lead by special interest groups like BRAF and their consultants Sasaki.
</P>

<P>Don't be fooled by big name international consultants. Don't let BREC rubberstamp consulting recommendations to avoid public debate. Don't let consultants mislead the public with surveys rigged to provide pre-determined outcomes. Don't let a series of closed eight person meetings with consultants in the backrooms of a $700 million non-profit organization obfuscate a coordinated effort to replace the stewardship of public lands currently vested in the hands of an (appointed/not voter derived) public board (i.e. BREC, who's board members are not subject to voter removal) replace that lacking stewardship with an even worse outcome; an outcome shaped by consultants and rubberstamped by an un-elected BREC board.  If BREC dares to give away portions of City Park Golf Course, dares to gaslight you by telling you there will still be a 9-hole course when their real intention is to shrink it 50% in size and scope, replace portions of the golf course with parking lots, buildings, wine bars under loud interstates, and new arboretums on stolen golf course land, remember their actions when tax votes come to the ballot box. You can't fire the board members, but you can defund BREC.  You can unseat the council members who appoint the BREC board commissioners. You can unseat a mayor who holds a BREC board seat. Let each complaint email be read, let each member of the public speak in a recorded video session posted publicly for all to see. Consider how BRAF's hand shaped the University Lakes Project and let their track record speak for itself. Did we need to fix the lakes? Yes. Did we spend the money well? Did BRAF decide what it wanted and then simply orchestrate a process upon the public to produce a predetermined outcome with a predetermined consultant? Consider that these same consultants reimagined what University Lakes could be and the results speak for themselves, being questionable at best. Has that effort provided a good value for money, a good result, a botched landscape, or destroyed the vistas on University Lake? Yes, the lakes achieved some dredging, but the disposal sites ruined the vistas and destroyed a 100 year old icon of Baton Rouge. Were tens of millions of taxpayer dollars well spent? Was the public input process fair? Was the process simply a gaslighting campaign by BRAF and consultants? Did that process mislead the public and deliver a different outcome? You can be the judge, but the same processes are hard at work to destroy the Historic City Park Golf Course in Baton Rouge.
</P>

<P>Are you aware a senior administrator in BREC is under public indictment?  Should the public really believe that processes that seek to hide in the shadows provide the public any level of confidence in BREC given the most recent indictments of one of its highest administrative managers?</P>

<P>If this concerns you as a citizen and a taxpayer.  Take action and tell BREC not to take one square foot of Historic City Park Golf Course. Join our cause to pushback on the political powerbrokers in Baton Rouge and simply keep our magnifcient oak lined fairways for future generations to enjoy for another 100 years to come.</P>
