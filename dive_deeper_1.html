    <h1>Dive Deeper 1</h1>
<P>The Historic City Park Golf Course of Baton Rouge located in the Garden District has been under threat from a diverse group of individuals, business interests, and city leaders for over two decades.  This continuous threat has now reached its pivotal moment. We need your immediate help as a concerned citizen to activate now with us to help save this 100 year old Historic Landmark in the heart of Baton Rouge.  
</P>

<P>We need you to demand that the golf course retain its current footprint, scale and scope. Tell the officials who represent you in city parish government (i.e. your parish council representative), tell the newspaper (call their switchboard and complain), tell the television broadcasters (call their switchboard and complain), tell self annoited and self appointed at Baton Rouge Area Foundation (BRAF), tell your neighbors that we do not want to re-imagine City Park, we do not want to change City Park if that entails destroying the existing golf course, reducing its historic nine-hole format, shrinking the size of the fairways and/or destroying or minimizing this cultural icon of the City of Baton Rouge that has severed as a recreational resource for all of East Baton Rouge Parish and State of Louisiana since its creation in 1926 over a century ago. 
</P>

<P>Progress does not mean bulldozers, wine shacks beneath a 120 decibel interstate, boathouses, greek outdoor ampitheaters and running trails to replace the timeless beauty of City Park Golf Course's historic fairways and greens. We say boo hoo to developers arboretuem too (you already have one next to the Main Library on Goodwood).  
</P>

<P>City Park Golf Course was designed to play golf and provide a green environment with an active lifestyle. It supports scenic beauty for walkers, joggers, golfers, and the general public just as it is. Yes, perhaps it could be a nicer golf course, but losing any piece of it will be a disaster.
</P>

<P>Are you the citizens of East Baton Rouge Parish aware that BREC has a 14.9 mil taxation slush fund, while the East Baton Rouge Parish general fund is supported by a mere 2.96 mil tax ? It's time we put an end to the land theft at City Park Golf Course and tell every mayor in the Parish to focus on roads, sewer, drainage, and crime."
</P>

<P>Admittedly, in our heart, we want to support BREC, we want to support BRAF, but when special interest take over these organizations, rather than improving the existing public golf course, we find ourselves desperately ringing the alarm to save the very existence of the golf course before it is bulldozed forever by private interest hiding under the banner of public progressive good.
</P>

<P>When BREC can publicly announce an memorialize in an offical public meeting that the footprint, scale and scope of the Historic City Park Golf Course will remain for unmolested for generations to come, we will forgive them for daring to destroy City Park Golf Course Baton Rouge, a Historic Landmark that we must preserve entirely for the future.  Only then can we support future milage for BREC.  If the money is to be misused and misappropriated, then we find it best untaxed.
</P>

<P>We can promise every BREC official, if you steal the Historic City Park Golf Course, if you shrink its size, if you alter its use; we will come for you at the next milage tax vote; we will gut your public funds and send you packing.

<P>The Threat | The Cabal | The Special Interest Groups | The Failure to Deliver on Public Projects | The Unnecessary Expenditures of Public Funds| Your Wasted Tax Dollars at Work | How BREC and City Leadership mislead the public on this Issue

</P>

<P>Your Civic Leaders at BREC continue to avoid public comment and hide their plans in restricted "stakeholder" meetings lead by special interest groups like BRAF and their New York consultants.
</P>

<P>Don't be fooled by big name international out of town New York consultants. Don't let BREC rubberstamp consulting recommendations to avoid public debate. Don't let consultants mislead the public with surveys rigged to provide pre-determined outcomes. Don't let a series of closed non-public meetings predetermine a staged public vote on the destiny of Historic City Park Golf Course.
</P>

<P>The unelected BREC commission is utilizing consultants in the backrooms of a $700 million non-profit organization to obfuscate a coordinated effort to replace the stewardship of public lands currently vested in governace of an appointed unelected public board (i.e. BREC [who's board members are not subject to voter removal]). Sadly, the BREC commission is attempting to further distance the public from oversight of the commission and its actions buy paying an international New York consultant to recommend that stewardship of public land be passed to a newly appointed commission (again unelected) with stewardship rights for ninety nine (99) years and a secondary option for ninety nine (99) more; The intent is clear, pay the consultants to deliver a backroom recommendation and rubberstamp the outcome with un-elected BREC board in a simple quick public meeting, all while claiming the board is following the recommendation of the so-called experts.  The cherry on top is your tax dollars pay for it.
</P>

<P>Understand how the system works.  BREC is an appointed board, whose members serve at the pleasure of the mayors within the Parish and the pleasure of the EBR metro council.  The public does not elect BREC commissioners directly.  However, with glee they annually spend a 14.9 mil tax.  This tax rivals in size and scope all other city parish taxes.  Furthermore, by slight of hand, the BREC commission routinely outsources the messy task of public decision making to consultants.  BREC pays the consultants and of course the "correct" recommedation is forthcoming in a special report.  BREC then simply rubberstamps the recommendation.  This is how your tax dollars are spent, out of sight of the public eye until its too late to change trajectory.  That's whats going on behind closed doors. Love it, Like it, Accept it or Demand Change and Transparency.
</P>

<P>If BREC dares to give away portions of Historic City Park Golf Course to special interest, dares to mislead and gaslight the citizens of East Baton Rouge Parish, dares to claim there will still be a 9-hole course when BREC's real intention is to shrink the golf course by 50% in size and scope while still calling it a nine hole 'Chip and Put', dares to replace portions of the golf course with parking lots, buildings, wine bars under loud interstates, boathouses, greek ampethatres, another arboretum, and jogging trails; let BREC know we, the taxpaying citizens of East Baton Rouge, the Voters of East Baton Rouge, will remember their actions, we will remember their theft, we will defund their taxation authority.   We will seek constantly to tell the public how the annual 14.9 mil tax funds BREC pensions while stealing public lands for special interest manipulation.
</P>

<P>Have we reminded you, the public, the fine taxpayers of East Baton Rouge Parish, that the BREC 14.9 mil annual tax rivals the fire department budget, rivals the police department budget, rivals the city general fund ?  While citizens struggle to pay their Delta Gas utility bills to heat their homes, BREC is handing its high price international New York consultants, at the behest of BRAF, a $600 thousand dollar contract for consulting to decide what recommodations are needed to reimagine City Park Golf Course and destroy it forever.
</P>

<P>You the taxpayer, the parish voter, you can't fire BREC board members, but you do have the power to defund BREC. You can slash their taxation at the ballot box upon its renewal. You can remember the public waste and vote down other useless taxation.  You can unseat the council members who appoint the BREC board commissioners. You can unseat the mayors who hold BREC board seats in their clutches.
</P>

<P>Let each voters voice be heard, let each tax payer speak with their vote, let each complaint email be read, let each member of the public speak in a recorded video session posted publicly for all to see. Consider how BRAF's hand shaped the University Lakes Project and let their track record speak for itself.  Are you aware the taxpayers have spent $87 million on the lakes project and our civic leaders are asking for more in appropriations and bond funds ?
</P>

<P>Did we need to fix the lakes? Yes. Did our civic leadership spend the money well? Did BRAF decide what it wanted and then simply orchestrate a process upon the public to produce a predetermined outcome with a predetermined consultant? Consider that these same consultants reimagined what University Lakes could be and the results speak for themselves, being questionable at best.
</P>

<P>Has that effort to dredge the lakes provided good value for money, a good result, a botched landscape, or has it simply destroyed the vistas on University Lake? Yes, the lakes project accomplished some dredging, but the disposal sites ruined the vistas and destroyed a 100 year old scienic cityscape of Baton Rouge. Were tens of millions of taxpayer dollars well spent?
</P>

<P>We entrust our mayors, and their appointees to hold our public resources dearly and steward our lands, lakes, and public assets with care a thought.  Instead we are witnessing the intential handover of said stewardship to special interest groups and international New York consultants who either don't care about Baton Rouge or don't understand it.
</P>

<P>Was the public input process on the lakes restoraton fair? Sadly, misdirection in public meetings lulled the citizenry to sleep while a cabal was busy at work passing land rights out of the hands of the public and into the hands of special interest.  Should we be surprised when those special interest groups start making bad decisions and approving poor plans that benefit themselves and ignore public interest?
</P>

<P>Was the process simply a gaslighting campaign by BRAF and consultants? Did that process mislead the public and deliver a different outcome? You can be the judge, but the same processes are hard at work to destroy the Historic City Park Golf Course in Baton Rouge.
</P>
    
<P>Are you aware a senior administrator in BREC is under public indictment?  Should the public really believe that processes that seek to hide in the shadows provide the public any level of confidence in BREC given the most recent indictments of one of its highest administrative managers?</P>

<P>If this concerns you as a citizen and a taxpayer, we urge you to immediately take action and tell BREC not to take one square foot of your Historic City Park Golf Course. Join our cause to challange the political powerbrokers in Baton Rouge and keep our magnifcient oak lined fairways for future generations to enjoy for another 100 years.</P>
