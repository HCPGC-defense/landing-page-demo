    <h1>Dive Deeper 1</h1>
<P>Historic City Park Golf Course in the Baton Rouge Garden District has been under threat from a cabal of city leaders for over two decades.  This never ending threat has reached its pivotal moment NOW in JANUARY AND FEBRUARY 2026. We need you to educate yourself and become a concerned citizen to help save this Historic Landmark.  We need you to dig deep into the roots of this ongoing problem and demand that City Park Golf Course retain its current footprint, scale, and scope. Tell your city leaders, tell the newspaper, tell the television broadcasters, tell BRAF, tell your neighbors we do not want to re-imagine City Park if that entails destroying the existing golf course, reducing its historic nine-hole format, shrinking the size of the fairways and/or destroying or minimizing a cultural icon of Baton Rouge that has severed as a recreational resource for the entire Parish and State since its creation in 1929 during the Great Depression.  Progress does not mean bulldozers and construction to replace City Park Golf Course's historical fairways and greens with new buildings, parking lots, arboretums and boat houses.  City Park Golf Course was designed to play golf and provide a green environment with an active lifestyle.

Your Civic Leaders at BREC are already underway to avoid public comment and hide their plans in restricted "stakeholder" meetings lead by special interest groups like BRAF and their consultants Sasaki.
</P>

<P>Don't be fooled by big name international consultants. Instead, measure their track record and consider the same consultants reimagined what University Lakes could be. Has that effort performed a good outcome or destroyed the vistas on University Lake? Were tens of millioons  of taxpayer dollars well spent? Was the public input process fair or simply a gaslighting campaign by BRAF and consultants? Did it mislead the public and deliver a different outcome? You can be the judge, but the same processes are hard at work to destroy the Historic City Park Golf Course in Baton Rouge.
