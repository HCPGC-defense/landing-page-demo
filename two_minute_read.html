        <p>Protect City Park Golf Course — Act Now (read <2 minutes)</p>
<p>City Park Golf Course (est. 1926; under public stewardship since 1929) is under renewed threat of partial or complete closure so the golf course land can be repurposed as a picnic area, amphitheater, cross country running and paved parking space for a lake boathouse. BREC claims might keep 15 minutes of golf play as a 70% reduced pitch and put. For decades the Baton Rouge Business Report, developers, BRAF, some city leaders, and various BREC commissioners have pushed this idea. Past attempts were defeated by public opposition — but the fight is back.</p>
<p>Key facts.</p>
<li>The course is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. </li>
<li>Rounds played have nearly doubled from 16,335 (2012) to 28,225 (FY2025). </li>
<li>Golf currently generates roughly $5 million/year in parish-wide revenue to BREC. </li>
<li>Golf will soon close at LSU, this will spike demand at City Park Golf Course and Webb Park Golf Course.  If City Park Golf Course is subsequently closed, only Webb Park Golf Course will remain. </li>
<li>If BREC shrinks, repurposes or closes the City Park Golf Course, the result will be wasted taxpayer spending on massive capital projects that do not bring any revenue. </li>
<li>Golf is complimentary to big event draws: The 2025 USBC Open Championships brought >$125M economic impact to Baton Rouge; enhanced golf could attract more championships. Out of town visitors play golf and contribute taxes when they come for other college sports events like an LSU game. </li>
<li>The course is self-sustaining and preserves public green space used daily for walking, jogging, biking, and recreation. </li>
<li>BREC has hired consultants (Sasaki) with a six hundred thousand dollar contract and is considering 99-year leases to private interest groups for lakefront areas — effectively privatizing public land. </li>
<li>A consultant survey appears structured to favor non-golf outcomes; answering it without due care could be used to justify shrinking or eliminating (closing) the course. </li>
<p>Why this matters.</p>
<li>Eliminating or reducing the course size would cut BREC revenue, likely increasing pressure for higher taxes or reallocation of BREC funds. </li>
<li>The course is a one hundred year old landmark that if closed can never reopen after the land is repurposed. </li>
<li>If the course closes BREC will spend tens of millions of dollars building alternative program use such as parking lots and new buildings. </li>
<li>The course supports broad diverse community participation. It is frequented by people of all ages and backgrounds. You will see high school players, college players, working age players, and retired senior players.  Tens of thousands of people enjoy the sport of golf.  Men and Women frequent the course regularly. </li>

<li>Complete the BREC survey only when ready — choose “golf” where allowed and use “Other” to write: “Support Golf Current Footprint / Keep 100% Golf / Support New Amenities Only Outside Existing Golf Areas.” </li>
<li>Revisit our site and share with friends at:</li><a href="https://protectcityparkgolfcoursebr.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration:underline;color:#0066cc;font-weight:600;font-size:18px;">www.ProtectCityParkGolfCourseBR.org.</a>
<li>Attend BREC meetings and voice support for keeping the historic city park golf course footprint completely intact. </li>
<li>Ask BREC to invest in underdeveloped areas only outside the current golf footprint (playgrounds, tracks, amenities) instead of repurposing the course. </li>

<p>Short ask.</p>
<li>Demand that City Park Golf Course remain whole, historic, and publicly controlled. Push BREC to preserve the golf footprint and spend on improvements around it — not on taking it.</li>
