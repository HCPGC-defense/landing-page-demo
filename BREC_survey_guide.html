        <h1>All of the survey questions deploy a common bias strategy.  They often exclude golf from the selection process.  They ask for five choices when only one choice can be golf.  Thus completing four non-golf items allows a narrative.  The biased consultants and BREC will claim, citizens are asking for many 'program uses' beyond golf and the only solution is to close or eliminate golf to make physical space for these new 'programed uses' or even 'quiet/nature uses'.  The point is, these secondary uses can occur elsewhere in the greater park footprint.  BREC knows exactly what they are.  They are listing them for you.  No matter how you try, BREC will twist the answer to tell the public the golf course must be closed.</h1>
        <h1>WHEN YOU ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS, REALIZE THAT EVERY TIME YOU SELECT AN OPTION LIKE WALKING, HIKING, MORE AMENITIES, AND INCLUSIVE ACCESS, ALL YOU ARE DOING IS PLAYING THEIR GAME.  BREC WANTS TO PUBLISH A RESULT THAT TELLS THE NARRATIVE THAT THE PUBLIC WANTS ANYTHING TO REPLACE GOLF: "THINK SIX OUT OF SEVEN PEOPLE CHOSE SOMETHING OTHER THAN GOLF". THAT's A BIASED SURVEY.</h1>
        <h1>SELECT GOLF ANYWHERE YOU ARE ALLOWED.  NOTICE IT’S NOT ALLOWED TOO OFTEN, BY DESIGN.  WHEN POSSIBLE, SELECT “OTHER” AND AS A WRITE-IN, TELL BREC “SAVE GOLF. 100 % SAME GOLF FOOTPRINT FOR 100 MORE YEARS!!”. IF YOU WISH, TELL BREC TO SPEND SOME MONEY IMPROVING THE GOLF COURSE TOO.  IT’S YOUR CHOICE.  THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT IS BREC CLOSING THE GOLF COURSE.</h1>
        <h1>BREC spends 40% of its $118M annual budget on saleries, fringe benefits, and pensions.  Is the public to assume for that kind of money BREC is incapable to know what the public want after 80 years of service? We think its more likely they wasting $600k on a consulting survey because it is the best way to manipulate the public and arrive at a pre-determined outcome to close the golf course.</h1>
        <h1>We ask that you AVOID selecting secondary 'program' use cases. BREC already knows these needs and is misleading and gas-lighting the public. We suggest SELECT ONLY "OTHER" checkbox and the write-in "Maximize golf footprint. Save our golf course 100% complete. Give the pulic options to improve golf resources.  Don't give us crumbs and cake."</h1>
