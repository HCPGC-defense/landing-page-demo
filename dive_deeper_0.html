        <li>There has been a decades long effort to steal large segments of the City Park Golf Course (Baton Rouge) or eliminate it completely and repurpose the land to a Cental Park.</li>
        
        <li>Various players are involved, business people, BRAF, BREC, city leaders on the metro council, mayors and/or their appointed representatives, and BREC Commissioners.</li>

        <li>The current situation is dire because the BREC Commission has set into play a consulting group to determine a best use recommendation for the land currently occupied by the golf course.</li>

        <li>The course is a Historic property in existence since 1926 and city stewardship since 1929. The Golf Course is on the National Historic Registar and older than 100 years in age.</li>

        <li>The course has positive net operating income and is self sustainable.  Utilization on the course has grown to over 28,000 rounds of annual play at the course.</li>

        <li>Tens of thousands of citizens enjoy the athestic beauty of the course on a regular basis.  Walking, jogging, riding bikes around the perimeter are daily exercises everyone can enjoy on a no fee basis.</li>

        <li>As you read this, BREC consultants are busy at work executing a strategy to prove that the golf course is the reamidy for a racial social problem in Baton Rouge.</li>

        <li>The consultant is laying the groundwork to make the claim that only by repurposing the golf course, can Baton Rouge through BREC right the wrong of a federal interstate program from the 1950s.</li>

        <li>Sadly, our city leaders are stuck in the past.  They don't recognize that golf is a sport enjoyed by people of all races, age, and social background.  Students and retirees, men and women, all races and religions, can find themselves enjoying the game of golf in small groups collectively learning about the humanity of their neighbor and diverse backgrounds and experiences.  Golfers know the Golf Course unites the community, rather than divides it.  Its a pity the city leaders insist on allowing a consultant from New York to perpetuate a theme that the land is a solution to a racial error seventy years old associated with the Interstate Construction of the 1950s.</li>

        <li>There is a growing dedicated group of citizens who enjoy playing golf in Baton Rouge.  However, most citizens do not belong to a private club.  Therefore options to play in town at a reasonable price are limited to three courses.  LSU golf course will soon close, putting further demand and pressure on the remaining courses.</li>

        <li>In an effort to produce a pre-determined desired outcome, the consultant has launched a survey.  Upon careful analysis, one can clearly see that by innocently answering the survey, the majority of all answers allowed by the consultant point to alternative use demands from the public.  In doing so, the consultant will report to BREC that the public supports six alternatives use cases beyond golf and thus golf is the lowest priority and should be eliminated or cut by 50% in land area.</li>  

        <li>BREC has its own tax milage of 14.9 mil rate.  Compare that to the general fund at 2.9 mils or the fire department at 8.9 Mils and taxpayers quickly understand BREC has money to burn, while you the taxpayer struggle to pay your Delta Utilities Gas Bill each month.</li>

        <li>BREC and its consultants will tell you that the golf course is racist or the interstate is racist and only golf course land can solve or correct a historic wrong.  BREC easily forgets or dismisses the fact that the golf course was integrated by a legendary member of the Baton Rouge community, Gen Marshall J Honore, in 1964.  The land physically splits and divides the community according to the consultant.  The consultant then portends to buttress their claim by highlighting that the railroad tracks and Dalrymple Drive are dividing lines between two communities.</li>  

        <li>BREC and its consultants will also tell you that the only way to resolve a historic wrong is to take the only available vacant land, that being City Park Golf Course and repurpose it.  What those consultants and BREC won't tell you is that the railroad tracks will remain and the road will remain and the enitre park area, no matter the use case will still be geographically divided by these transporation routes.  Must we then conclude that the only way to solve a historic racial error of the past is to destroy the repurposed park and turn it into a parking lot?</li>
        
        <li>Recoginize that your innocent participation in BREC's survey could be utilized by BREC and BRAF to expropriate much of City Park Golf Course for alternative use.</li>

        <li>Admittedly, we like golf, other people like tennis, some like art, others like walking, jogging, and sitting in the grass.  All these activities have coexisted in harmony for decades.  Until now, BREC and some of your civic leaders are determined to take the golf course for their own purposes.</li>

        <li>We kindly ask that should you complete the BREC survey, that you do not play their game.  Leave their choices blank.  Select golf the few opportunities that you are allowed to.  Check the other box and write in Support Golf / Keep 100% as your winning response.</li>
        
        <li>Soon we will publish our more detailed guide to help complete the BREC survey without sabotaging City Park Golf Course NOTE: this website will have an advisory soon regarding a manipulative BREC survey orchestrated by its consultants).</li>
        
        <li>The clock is ticking. Citizens have less than two weeks to mobilize to stop the golf course land grab.</li>
        
        <li>Go to our website ( www.ProtectCityParkGolfCourseBR.org ) and come back often in the month of February; we plan to have weekly, possibly daily updates.</li>

        <li>There is much more to the story, but on this tab, we are trying to just give you the highlights.  If you learn nothing else, please note BREC is buring your money on an unncessary consultant study and an uncessary land taking.  Saving the golf course could have cost zero dollars, but now we must fight to protect it for future generations.  There are many ways BREC can enhance surrounding park land without taking one square foot of the golf course, but they won't enjoy the pleasure of burning your tax dollars unless they take the most historic parcel and repurpose it.</li>

        <li>When you open your wallet and wonder where the money went, when you hit the next pothole on city streets, remember BREC burned some of your tax dollars on frivolous projects and they are looking for another to spend more of your tax dollars to the tune of tens of millions.  Did we mention they all get fat pensions and salaries to boot?.</li>
